# Maze Dungeon Game

## Overview
This is a simple maze game where the player controls an animated person. They navigate through the maze as they collect different collectibles/treasures. When all collectibles/treasures have been collected, it transitions to the next level. Once all the levels have been completed within the 1 minute time duration, the game ends. The player's score is constantly updated as they collect the treasures.


The game challenges players with time constraints and strategic movements to maximize their score while avoiding hazards.
